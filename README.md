# :gear: My Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for Xmonad/Arch. **_Please do not blindly execute `dotfiles.sh`; it is highly personalized._**
* `dotfiles.sh` initializes my system by creating symlinks, cloning repos, and installing scripts.
* `setup.md` walks me through a typical Arch install, and, after `dotfiles.sh`, some extra configurations.
